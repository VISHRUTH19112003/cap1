/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for NyayaGPT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, documents, and application settings.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores UserProfile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/documents/{documentId}: Stores legal documents uploaded by each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/applicationSettings/{settingId}: Stores user-specific application settings.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly denied (no rule allows it).
 * - The rules explicitly deny any write operation that attempts to violate the ownership model.
 * - Data validation is relaxed during this prototyping phase with the exception of critical fields such as userId.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Each Document and ApplicationSetting stores a userId field, which is validated against the path to prevent unauthorized access.
